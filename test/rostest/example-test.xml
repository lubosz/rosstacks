  <!--

    Tests are nodes that implement one of the xUnit-style test cases
    (e.g. googletest, unittest). They must output their results in the
    xUnit-style XML format.

    You define tests just like a node except you must also specify a
    test-name and you can't use a respawn attribute

    A roslaunch file may contain multiple tests. They will be run in
    the order you specify. Between each test, the entire roslaunch
    will be restarted, including the master (your master 'auto'
    setting will be overriden during rostest).
