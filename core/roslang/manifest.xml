  <description brief="ROS client library base">

     roslang is a common package that all
     <a href="http://www.ros.org/wiki/Client%20Libraries">ROS client
     libraries</a> depend on.  This is mainly used to find client
     libraries (via 'rospack depends-on1 roslang'), but could come to
     include common client library code, such as an .msg / .srv
     parser.
