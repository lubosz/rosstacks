  <description brief="A ROS system dependency manager">

rosdep attempts to help you manage the external dependencies of ROS. Because
the ROS codebase is so wide-ranging, these dependencies can be hard to map onto
your system. For example, what packages do you need in order to get the OpenGL
headers on Ubuntu? (answer: libgl1-mesa-dev and libglu1-mesa-dev). These
package names can sometimes be unfriendly, and, much more seriously, they
usually vary slightly from one operating system or Linux distribution to
another (e.g., Debian/Ubuntu versus Fedora), and can even vary between
different versions of the same distribution. Enter rosdep.

The commandline API has been reviewed and will remain stable.  The
internal code API is subject to change in future releases.

The yaml format is stable. There may be a few extensions to the
syntax, but all changes will keep backwards compatability.
