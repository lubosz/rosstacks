\section overview Overview

\b %rospack is the ROS package management tool.  The %rospack package contains
a single binary, called \b %rospack.

 - Jump to \ref Usage "command-line usage".

%rospack is part dpkg, part pkg-config.  The main function of %rospack is
to crawl through the packages in ROS_ROOT and ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, read and
parse the \b manifest.xml for each package, and assemble a complete
dependency tree for all packages.

Using this tree, %rospack can answer a number of queries about packages and
their dependencies.  Common queries include:
 - find : return the absolute path to a package
 - depends : return a list of all of a package's dependencies
 - depends-on : return a list of packages that depend on the given package
 - export : return flags necessary for building and linking against a package

%rospack is intended to be cross-platform.

\subsection crawling Crawling algorithm
%rospack crawls in the following order: the directory ROS_ROOT, followed by
the colon-separated list of directories ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, in the order they
are listed.

During the crawl, %rospack examines the contents of each directory, looking
for a file called @b manifest.xml.  If such a file is found, the directory
containing it is considered to be a ROS package, with the package name
equal to the directory name.  The crawl does not descend further once a
manifest is found (i.e., packages cannot be nested inside one another).  

If a manifest.xml file is not found in a given directory, each subdirectory
is searched.  This subdirectory search is prevented if a file called @b
rospack_nosubdirs is found.  The directory itself is still searched for a
manifest, but its subdirectories are not crawled.

If multiple packages by the same name exist within the search path, the
first one found wins.  It is strongly recommended that you keep packages by
the same name in separate trees, each having its own element within
ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.  That way, you can deterministically control the search
order by the way that you specify ROS_PACKAGE_PATH.  The search order
within a given element of ROS_PACKAGE_PATH can be unpredictably affected by
the details of how files are laid out on disk.

\subsection efficiency Efficiency considerations
%rospack re-parses the manifest.xml files and rebuilds the dependency tree
on each execution.  However, it maintains a cache of package directories in
ROS_ROOT/.rospack_cache.  This cache is updated whenever there is a cache
miss, or when the cache is 60 seconds old.  You can change this timeout by
setting the environment variable ROS_CACHE_TIMEOUT, in seconds.  Set it to
0.0 to force a cache rebuild on every invocation of %rospack.

%rospack's performance can be adversely affected by the presence of very
broad and/or deep directory structures that don't contain manifest files.
If such directories are in %rospack's search path, it can spend a lot of
time crawling them only to discover that there are no packages to be found.
You can prevent this latency by creating a @b rospack_nosubdirs file in
such directories. If rospack seems to be running annoyingly slowly, you
can use the profile command, which will print out the 20 slowest trees
to crawl (or use profile --length=N to print the slowest N trees).

\subsection dependencies No dependencies
Because %rospack is the tool that determines dependencies, it cannot depend
on anything else.  Thus %rospack contains a copy of the TinyXML library,
instead of using the copy available in 3rdparty.  For the same reason, unit
tests for %rospack, which require gtest, are in a separate package, called
rospack_test.

\section codeapi Code API

%rospack is used entirely as a command-line tool.  While the main
functionality within %rospack is built as a library for testing purposes,
it is not intended for use in writing other applications.  Should this
change, the %rospack library API should be cleaned up and better
documented.

For now, the user-visible API is:
 - rospack::ROSPack::ROSPack()
 - rospack::ROSPack::run()

See main.cpp for example usage

\section rosapi ROS API
%rospack does not expose a ROS API.

\section commandline Command-line tools

\subsection rospack rospack

%rospack is the command-line tool that provides package management services.

%rospack crawls the directory ROS_ROOT and the colon-separated directories
in ROS_PACKAGE_PATH, determining a directory to be package if it contains a
file called @b manifest.xml.

\subsubsection Usage
\verbatim
$ rospack [options] <command> [package]
   Allowed commands:
     help
     find [package]
     list
     list-names
     langs
     depends [package] (alias: deps)
     depends1 [package] (alias: deps1)
     depends-manifests [package] (alias: deps-manifests)
     depends-indent [package] (alias: deps-indent)
     vcs [package]
     vcs0 [package]
     depends-on [package]
     depends-on1 [package]
     export [--deps-only] --lang=<lang> --attrib=<attrib> [package]
     cflags-only-I [--deps-only] [package]
     cflags-only-other [--deps-only] [package]
     libs-only-L [--deps-only] [package]
     libs-only-l [--deps-only] [package]
     libs-only-other [--deps-only] [package]
     profile [--length=<length>] [--zombie-only]
     plugins --attrib=<attrib> [--top=<toppkg>] [package]

If [package] is omitted, the current working directory
is used (if it contains a manifest.xml). 
\endverbatim

Subcommand detail.  All subcommands "return" their results by printing to
stdout.  Any errors or warnings go to stderr.  This separation ensures that
error output does not confuse programs that execute %rospack as a subprocess
to, for example, recover build flags for a package.

 - @b help : help message.

 - <b>find [package]</b> : absolute path to the package, empty string if package is not found
   - Used within many tools, including rosrun and roslaunch.

 - <b>list</b>  : newline-separated list "[package-name] [package-dir]" for all packages

 - <b>list-names</b>  : newline-separated list of "[package-name]" for all packages

 - <b>langs</b>  : space-separated list of available language-specific client libraries (e.g., "rospy roscpp")
   - Returns the list of packages that depend directly on the placeholder package @b roslang, minus any packages that are listed in the environment variable @b ROS_LANG_DISABLE.

 - <b>deps [package]</b>  : newline-separated ordered list of all dependencies of the package
   - Used within rosmake

 - <b>deps-manifests [package]</b>  : space-separated ordered list of manifest.xml files for all dependencies of the package
   - Used within rosbuild.cmake to create explicit dependencies from source files to other packages' manifests.

 - <b>deps-indent [package]</b>  : newline-separated presentation of the entire dependency chain for the package, indented to indicate where in the chain each dependency arises.  May contain duplicates.

 - <b>deps1 [package]</b>  : newline-separated ordered list of immediate dependencies of the package

 - <b>vcs [package]</b>  : newline-separated list of all [versioncontrol] tags from the manifest.xml of the package and all of its dependencies
   - Useful for pre-caching SSL certificates for https SVN servers that
     will be contacted during the build, to avoid having to manually accept the
     certificates during the build.

 - <b>vcs0 [package]</b>  : newline-separated list of all [versioncontrol] tags from the manifest.xml of just the package itself
   - Useful for pre-caching SSL certificates for https SVN servers that
     will be contacted during the build, to avoid having to manually accept the
     certificates during the build.

 - <b>depends-on [package]</b> : newline-separated list of all packages that depend on the package

 - <b>depends-on1 [package]</b> : newline-separated list of all packages that directly depend on the package

 - <b>export [--deps-only] --lang=LANGUAGE --attrib=ATTRIBUTE [package]</b> : Space-separated list of [export][LANGUAGE ATTRIBUTE=""/][/export] values from the manifest.xml of the package and its dependencies.  If --deps-only is provided, then the package itself is excluded.
   - Useful for getting language-specific build flags, e.g,. export/cpp/cflags.

 - <b>cflags-only-I [--deps-only] [package]</b> : Special case of export.  Space-separated list of export/cpp/cflags that start with @b -I.  If --deps-only is provided, then the package itself is excluded.
  - Used within rosbuild.cmake to assemble include paths for compiling.

 - <b>cflags-only-other [--deps-only] [package]</b> : Special case of export.  Space-separated list of export/cpp/cflags that don't start with @b -I.  If --deps-only is provided, then the package itself is excluded.
  - Used within rosbuild.cmake to assemble non-include compile flags.

 - <b>libs-only-L [--deps-only] [package]</b> : Special case of export.  Space-separated list of export/cpp/libs that start with @b -L.  If --deps-only is provided, then the package itself is excluded.
  - Used within rosbuild.cmake to assemble library search paths for linking.

 - <b>libs-only-l [--deps-only] [package]</b> : Special case of export.  Space-separated list of export/cpp/libs that start with @b -l.  If --deps-only is provided, then the package itself is excluded.
  - Used within rosbuild.cmake to assemble libraries for linking.

 - <b>libs-only-other [--deps-only] [package]</b> : Special case of export.  Space-separated list of export/cpp/libs that don't start with @b -l or @b -L.  If --deps-only is provided, then the package itself is excluded.
  - Used within rosbuild.cmake to assemble non-library link flags.

 - <b>profile [--length=N] [--zombie-only] </b> : Force a full crawl of package directories (i.e., don't use cache, and report to console on the N (default 20) directories that took the longest time to crawl.  Useful for finding stray directories that are adversely affecting rospack's performance.  If --zombie-only is given, then only the directories without any manifests in them are printed.  In this case, the output can be fed directly into rm to clean up your tree, e.g.: rospack profile --zombie-only | xargs rm -rf.  @b Note: be sure to check the output before deleting any files!

 - <b>plugins --attrib=<attrib> [--top=<toppkg>] [package] </b> : Examine packages that depend directly on the given package, extracting from each the value of an exported attribute with the name <attrib>.  All matching exports are returned, newline-separated.  E.g., if the manifest for a package "foo," located at /tmp/foo, contains:
\verbatim
<export>
  <rosbuild cmake="${prefix}/cmake/foo.cmake/>
</export>
\endverbatim
then "rospack plugins --attrib=cmake rosbuild" will return (at least):
\verbatim
/tmp/foo/cmake/foo.cmake
\endverbatim
If --top=<toppkg> is given, then in addition to depending directly on the given package, to be scanned for exports, a package must also be a dependency of <toppkg>, or be <toppkg> itself.
