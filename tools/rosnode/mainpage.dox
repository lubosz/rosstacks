\b rosnode is a command-line tool for displaying debug information about nodes. It also contains an experimental Python library for retrieving information about ROS Nodes. The rosnode Python library is currently for internal-use only as its API is not stable.

Please see the Wiki page for documentation on the rosnode tool.
