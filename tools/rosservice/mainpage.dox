\b rosservice contains the rosservice command-line tool for listing
and querying ROS services. It also contains a Python library for
getting information about Services, as well as dynamically invoking
them without prior information about their type. The rosservice Python
library is currently for internal-use only as its API is not stable.

Please see the Wiki page for documentation on the rosservice tool.
