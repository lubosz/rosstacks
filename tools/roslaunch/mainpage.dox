@b roslaunch is a tool for launching ROS nodes locally and remotely
via SSH. roslaunch is configured with XML-based config files that end
with a '.launch' extension.  These config files can include other
config files, enabling you to easily compose larger roslaunch
configurations.

roslaunch has been used by other packages as a library for launching nodes.
This usage is not generally recommended as roslaunch's internal API
is still unstable.
