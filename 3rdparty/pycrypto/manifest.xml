<description brief="Python Cryptography Toolkit">

  <p>
  pycrypto contains the 
  <a href="http://www.amk.ca/files/python/crypto/">Python Cryptography Toolkit</a>.
  This is a thirdparty package that is included mainly to support
  the <a href="http://www.ros.org/wiki/paramiko">paramiko SSH library</a>,
  which is also included with ROS.
  </p>
  <p>
  This package contains version 2.0.1 of Python-Crypto, which is the last
  version released by A.M. Kuchling. It has since been taken over by 
  Dwayne C. Liteznberger, but there are no new releases. 
  The hope is to update to newer versions of Python-Crypto
  as soon as they become available -- the 2.0.1 version contains deprecation
  warnings with Python 2.6 and reportedly has other bugs worth fixing.
