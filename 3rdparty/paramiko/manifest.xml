  <description brief="Paramiko SSH library for Python">

  Download-based ROS installer for the Paramiko library by
  Robey Pointer (http://www.lag.net/paramiko/).

  Paramiko is a library for making SSH2 connections (client or
  server).  Emphasis is on using SSH2 as an alternative to SSL for
  making secure connections between python scripts.  All major ciphers
  and hash methods are supported.  SFTP client and server mode are
  both supported too.
        
  Paramiko is used by the roslaunch tool to enable remote node launching.

  While paramiko is available via package managers, the versions available
  are grossly out of date.
