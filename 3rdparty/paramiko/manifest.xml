  is a pure-Python library for making SSH2 connections (client or
  server). It's main use within ROS is to support remote launching
  for <a href="http://www.ros.org/wiki/roslaunch">roslaunch</a>.

  This ROS package wraps Paramiko 1.7.5 "Ernest", which was released
  on July 19, 2009. While paramiko is available via OS package managers,
  the versions available are out of date and do not contain the
  latest security fixes. This package will be updated as new versions
  of Paramiko are released.
